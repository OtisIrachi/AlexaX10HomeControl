# AlexaX10IR
***WEBSITE UNDER DEVELOPMENT***  STAY TUNED!

Control X10 and IR devices using Alexa with voice commands, or remotely using a smart phone via a web page. 

This is a simple Home and Media Center controller using an ESP8266 WiFi Module and
an 0.96" oLED Display.  X10 commands are transmitted with the X10 PowerLine module.
Several Libraries will need to be loaded to support this project:
